# LeNet-MNIST-dataset
Original Paper Gradient Based Learning Applied to Document Recognition
The Authors define this network as Multi Layer Neural Network trained with Gradient Descent Algorithm.According to them this network can used for classification of high dimensional patterns such as hand written character with minimal processing.

# Traditional Pattern Recognition 
It consist of two modules : a) a fixed feature extractor and b) trainable classifier. However , the issue was that we had to obtain appropriate feature extractor for each classification task as these classifiers were limited to low dimensional spaces with separable classes.
Or, in other we had to use classifier for simple classification tasks also each classifiers was to be hand crafted.However , LeNet-5 (having Multi-Layer-Perceptron with Stochastics Gradient Descent) make learning these features extraction automatic as the network learns these during training and we donot have to hand craft each feature.

# Reasons for these phenomenal shift in paradigm

The main reasons cited by the authors include 
a) availability of low-cost computers to allow more brute force "numerical methods" than algorithm refinement.
b) second , availability of large databases for the problem allowing for more training samples to learn the mapping.
c) Third , is the avialability of powerful machine learning techniques that can be used to handle high-dimensional input to generate intricate decision functions which when fed with large databases.
